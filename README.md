# Code sourcing

I watched some Youtube videos and played with existing code on Github. I also had to use materials from the MongoDB documentation and bits of code clipped from "Solved" exercises in class, as well as examples found on the internet to troubleshoot why I was having issues loading my database in. After some time wasted I realized I was attempting to finish the analysis notebook prior to running the setup code to actually make changes to the database. Sounds about right!
